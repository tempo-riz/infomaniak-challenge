# infomaniak-challenge

The concept is to realize a portion of one of our pages using a Figma Model.

## Stack to use

* React
* Material UI
* React-intl
* An approach hook/component

## Bonus

* Animation

## Instructions

The link to the Figma board is the following: [https://www.figma.com/file/MkIPZTAORxktqqK7llpyen/Exercice-Front?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/MkIPZTAORxktqqK7llpyen/Exercice-Front?node-id=0:1)

In addition to the board, you must add a button; you can choose where to place it to allow the user to change his language from FR to EN. The translation is optional. A simple lorem Ipsum in the other language will fit perfectly.

The "En savoir plus" links don't need to point to an actual page but must be implemented and visible.

The Figma Model shows a desktop version of the application. We ask that you also create a responsive mobile version of the site.


## USAGE

### `npm install`

Installs all the dependencies needed for the project to run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
