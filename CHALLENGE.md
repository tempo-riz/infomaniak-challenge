# infomaniak-challenge

The concept is to realize a portion of one of our pages using a Figma Model.

## Stack to use

* React
* Material UI
* React-intl
* An approach hook/component

## Bonus

* Animation

## Instructions

The link to the Figma board is the following: [https://www.figma.com/file/MkIPZTAORxktqqK7llpyen/Exercice-Front?node-id=0%3A1](https://www.figma.com/file/MkIPZTAORxktqqK7llpyen/Exercice-Front?node-id=0:1)

In addition to the board, you must add a button; you can choose where to place it to allow the user to change his language from FR to EN. The translation is optional. A simple lorem Ipsum in the other language will fit perfectly.

The "En savoir plus" links don't need to point to an actual page but must be implemented and visible.

The Figma Model shows a desktop version of the application. We ask that you also create a responsive mobile version of the site.
